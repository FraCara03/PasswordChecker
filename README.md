This is the *Password Checker* project I made myself.


<p>In ancient times, the concept of passwords existed, and they are still widely used today. Passwords are essential for online security, and using the internet without them is nearly impossible. To ensure your safety, platforms like Google recommend strong, auto-generated passwords that are difficult to remember without password managers. It would be worthwhile to develop a tool that checks how often your commonly used passwords have been compromised, as this can help you assess the strength of your passwords.
